DESCRIPTION

This Filipino Pancit recipe comes from the orphanage that I worked at for a year in Cebu. It’s my all-time favorite Filipino recipe!

INGREDIENTS

2 lbs. uncooked noodles – this version used a combination of pancit and vermicelli
4 cups sliced mixed veggies: cabbage, carrots, bell peppers, and green onions
1 lb. lean pork, cut into very small pieces
½ cup oil
1 onion, minced
1 tablespoon soy sauce
6 cloves garlic, crushed
1 pork bouillon cube
6 cups water

INSTRUCTIONS

Soak the vermicelli in water for about 5 minutes or until soft.

Brown the pork in the oil with the soy sauce, garlic, and onion.

Add the water and bouillon cube to the pork and bring to a low simmer. 
Add the vegetables and cook for 5-10 minutes. 
Add the uncooked pancit noodles and soaked vermicelli. 
Simmer over low heat until the noodles soak up all the broth.
